  Agent reported findings from UOW-05 revision #2 TypeScript compilation fix.
  
  Findings Summary:
  - Added @types/three@0.167.2 as devDependency to provide TypeScript type definitions
  - Applied Three.js type import pattern: import { ..., type Object3D } from 'three'
  - Narrowed disposeMaterial signature from Material | Material[] | undefined to Material | Material[]
  - Added explicit Object3D type annotation in scene.traverse callback
  - All quality gates passed: npx tsc --noEmit, targeted vitest (6/6), targeted lint
  
  Knowledge Additions:
  - accumulated-knowledge.md: Added new section "TypeScript Strict Compilation Fixes for Renderer Adapter (UOW-05 Revision #2)"
  - learnings.json: Added 5 new learning entries (learn-026 through learn-030):
    * learn-026: @types/three dependency requirement
    * learn-027: Three.js type import pattern
    * learn-028: Method signature narrowing by removing undefined
    * learn-029: Explicit Object3D type annotation for scene traversal
    * learn-030: Minimal scoped TypeScript compile fix pattern
  - information-index.json: Added "dependencies" category, extended "code-patterns" and "build-issues" categories with new subcategories
  
  Taxonomy Changes:
  - New category: "dependencies" with subcategory "threejs-types"
  - Extended code-patterns subcategories: threejs-type-imports, signature-narrowing, threejs-traverse-typing
  - Extended build-issues subcategories: dependency-resolution
  - Updated by_file mappings for package.json and renderer-adapter.service.ts
  - Updated by_keyword mappings for typescript, strict mode, three.js, type imports, etc.
  - Updated by_context mapping for UOW-05-revision-2
