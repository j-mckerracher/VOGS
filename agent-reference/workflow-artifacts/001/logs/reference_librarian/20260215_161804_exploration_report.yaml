  Received exploration findings from software_engineer for change_id 001 UOW-02.
  
  Key findings:
  - No existing src tree present prior to UOW-02
  - Created foundational model files in src/app/core/models/
  - Created configuration constants in src/app/core/config/
  - Established type-safe model pattern: readonly const arrays + derived union types
  - Established immutable config pattern: 'as const' assertions
  
  Knowledge updates:
  - Added "Core Models and Configuration Patterns (UOW-02)" section to accumulated-knowledge.md
  - Added 3 new learnings to learnings.json (learn-005, learn-006, learn-007)
  - Created 2 new categories in information-index.json: "code-patterns" and "project-structure"
  - Updated retrieval patterns (by_file, by_keyword, by_context)
  - Recorded schema change with rationale
  
  These patterns now form the baseline for future model and configuration file creation.
