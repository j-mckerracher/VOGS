  Agent reported exploration findings for UOW-11. Added comprehensive knowledge about:
  1. Asset budget validation script (scripts/check-asset-budget.mjs) with 2M byte threshold
  2. Manifest contract validation script (scripts/validate-manifest.mjs) for required fields
  3. SCENE_MANIFEST_PATH environment variable override pattern for test fixtures
  4. process.exitCode=1 exit pattern for CI/CD integration
  5. npm script quality gate chain integration (check:asset-budget, check:manifest-contract)
  
  Knowledge entries created:
  - learn-031: Asset budget validation with environment-based fixture override
  - learn-032: Manifest contract validation with required fields and value constraints
  - learn-033: Non-throwing validation exit with process.exitCode for CI/CD integration
  - learn-034: Environment variable-based fixture path override for validation testing
  - learn-035: Chained npm script quality gates for comprehensive validation
  
  Updated information-index.json:
  - Extended verification-scripts category with asset-budget-validation and manifest-contract-validation subcategories
  - Extended code-patterns category with validation-exit-code-pattern subcategory
  - Extended workspace-setup category with npm-script-quality-gates subcategory
  - Extended testing category with environment-fixture-override subcategory
  - Added keyword mappings for: asset budget, ASSET_BUDGET_ERROR, scene size, exit code, process.exitCode,
    SCENE_MANIFEST_PATH, fixture override, manifest, contract validation, schema validation, required fields,
    fusion modes, representation modes, field paths, validation errors, non-zero exit, graceful shutdown,
    fail fast, npm script chains, quality gate, CI/CD, validation chain, script composition
  - Updated retrieval patterns by file, keyword, and context for UOW-11
  - Recorded schema change: added 5 new subcategories across 4 categories
