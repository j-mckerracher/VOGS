  Found prior knowledge from UOW-02 about model patterns and TypeScript conventions.
  No UOW-03 planning documentation exists in codebase yet.
  No existing store/service/signal patterns found - this is greenfield state management.
  Delegated codebase exploration to discover Angular version, dependencies, and existing patterns.
  Angular 18.2.0 with RxJS 7.8.1 installed but no state management library.
  Added question to standing-questions.md about UOW-03 planning documentation location.
