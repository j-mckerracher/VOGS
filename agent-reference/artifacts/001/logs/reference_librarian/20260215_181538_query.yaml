  Software engineer reported exploration findings for UOW-06 implementation patterns.
  Findings covered:
  - Service test pattern: direct class instantiation without TestBed
  - LoadEvent types: defined inline in scene-asset.service.ts
  - Demo feature folder: does not yet exist, requires creation
  - State store pattern: setLoadState({status, error}) for load state transitions
  - Integration spec requirements: test both success (loading->ready) and failure (loading->failed) branches
  
  Added comprehensive entry to accumulated-knowledge.md with implementation details and code examples.
  Created 5 new learning entries (learn-036 through learn-040) covering:
  - learn-036: Service test pattern without TestBed
  - learn-037: Inline LoadEvent type definitions
  - learn-038: Demo feature folder greenfield status
  - learn-039: State store setLoadState pattern
  - learn-040: Integration testing requirements for orchestration
  
  Updated information-index.json:
  - Extended testing category with integration-testing subcategory
  - Added keywords: service tests, class instantiation, no TestBed, inline types, LoadEvent, demo, folder structure, load state, setLoadState, deterministic orchestration, success/failure branches
  - Updated retrieval patterns for service files and demo folder
  - Added UOW-06 context mapping
  - Added schema change entry for 2025-02-15
  
  All knowledge successfully captured and indexed for future retrieval.
