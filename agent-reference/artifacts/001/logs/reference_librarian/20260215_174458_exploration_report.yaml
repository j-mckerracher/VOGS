  Agent reported completion of UOW-05 renderer adapter implementation with the following findings:
  
  1. Created renderer-adapter.service.ts with idempotent guard pattern (if (this.fusionMode === mode) return;)
  2. Implemented proper Three.js disposal pattern with setAnimationLoop(null) before dispose()
  3. Created ParsedScenePayload model for scene data structure
  4. Tests pass with --environment node flag (consistent with jsdom dependency issue)
  5. Build fails due to missing @angular-devkit/build-angular:application builder package
  
  Added four new learnings to knowledge base:
  - learn-022: Idempotent guard pattern for state-changing methods
  - learn-023: Three.js renderer disposal with animation loop teardown
  - learn-024: ParsedScenePayload model structure
  - learn-025: Missing Angular builder dependency issue
  
  Updated information-index.json with:
  - New build-issues category
  - Extended code-patterns with idempotent-guards, threejs-disposal, parsed-scene-payload subcategories
  - Added UOW-05 context mapping
  - Updated keyword index for new patterns
  
  Added comprehensive narrative entry to accumulated-knowledge.md documenting the implementation patterns,
  code examples, and additional context about build dependencies.
