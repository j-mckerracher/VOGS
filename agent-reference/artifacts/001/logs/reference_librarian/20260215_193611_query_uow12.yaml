processing_notes: "Found UOW-12 spec with DoD and constraints. Found existing Playwright patterns in demo-flow.spec.ts. Found ground_truth disable patterns from UOW-07. Missing: comprehensive accessibility testing patterns, detailed AC flow assertion examples, focus/contrast/ARIA baseline patterns need exploration."
