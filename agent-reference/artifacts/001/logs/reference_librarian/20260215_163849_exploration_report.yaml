  Agent reported findings from UOW-04 exploration. Added comprehensive knowledge entry to accumulated-knowledge.md covering:
  - Scene asset service timeout requirements (12 seconds)
  - Retry policy (exactly one retry for transient network errors)
  - LoadEvent union types (loading|ready|failed)
  - Error taxonomy (ASSET_FETCH_ERROR, ASSET_PARSE_ERROR, ASSET_BUDGET_ERROR)
  
  Updated learnings.json with 4 new structured learning entries:
  - learn-012: HTTP timeout/retry policy requirements
  - learn-013: LoadEvent union type pattern
  - learn-014: Asset error taxonomy
  - learn-015: Error handling file organization
  
  Updated information-index.json with 2 new categories:
  - service-requirements: HTTP/timeout/retry/network configuration
  - error-handling: Error taxonomy and error classes
  
  Added keywords, retrieval patterns, and schema change documentation for fast future retrieval.
