Added comprehensive knowledge about signal-based state management with FusionStoreService including: (1) Angular signals pattern with private writable signal and readonly computed selectors (learn-008), (2) Vitest environment configuration issue requiring --environment node flag (learn-009), (3) Business rule enforcement via early-return guard pattern (learn-010), (4) Service organization with co-located test files (learn-011). Extended information-index.json taxonomy with new subcategories for signal-based-state-management, business-rule-enforcement, service-organization, and vitest-environment-configuration. Added new 'testing' category to support future test-related queries.",
