  Query requested 4 items:
  1. workflow-config.yaml paths - NOT FOUND (file doesn't exist in repo)
  2. eslint config learnings - FOUND (learn-002 covers eslint.config.js baseline)
  3. UOW docs/evaluator feedback - PARTIALLY FOUND (no impl_report.yaml or evaluator feedback files exist yet for UOW-01)
  4. Confidence - PARTIAL (can answer #2, need exploration for #1 and #3)
  
  ISSUE: User mentioned evaluator fix E1 and impl_report.yaml, but these artifacts don't exist yet.
  This suggests the workflow structure may not be set up as expected, or files are in a different location.
  
  Added question to standing-questions.md about missing workflow-config.yaml and artifact structure.
