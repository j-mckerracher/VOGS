processing_notes: "Agent reported findings from UOW-12 exploration. Added Playwright/vitest guard pattern, state transition patterns, error overlay accessibility (dialog role, aria-modal, focus trap, focus restore), ground_truth mode control disabling, and Playwright accessibility testing approach (no axe dependency). Added two new categories to information index: 'accessibility' and 'feature-behavior'."
