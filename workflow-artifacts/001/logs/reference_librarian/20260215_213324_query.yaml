  UI QA Agent reported verification findings after initial discrepancies were corrected.
  Key findings:
  - hero-section.component.ts now uses styleUrls array (corrected from styleUrl string)
  - View Demo button correctly focuses #demo-section (INT-002 resolution)
  - Error overlay dialog states validated (UI-004: visible/focus/tab-trap/retry-hide)
  - QA methodology uses same-type baseline comparisons for accurate validation
  
  Added comprehensive verification entry to accumulated-knowledge.md and structured 
  learning (learn-058) to learnings.json under ui-ux-standards category.
